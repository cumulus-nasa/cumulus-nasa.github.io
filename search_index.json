Description\nThis Cumulus project seeks to address the existing need for a “native” cloud-based data ingest, archive, distribution, and management system that can be used for all future Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) data streams via the development and implementation of Cumulus. The term “native” implies that the system will leverage all components of a cloud infrastructure provided by the vendor for efficiency (in terms of both processing time and cost). Additionally, Cumulus will operate on future data streams involving satellite missions, aircraft missions, and field campaigns. \nThis documentation includes both guidelines, examples and source code docs.\nThe documentation is accessible at https://cumulus-nasa.github.io/\nContributing\nPlease refer to: https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for information\nContent\nDocumentation\n\nArchitecture\nCumulus Deployment\nCreating an S3 Bucket\nLocating IAMs\nTroubleshooting Deployment\n\n\nCumulus Workflows\nProtocol\nInput & Ouptut\nCumulus Task Message Flow\nDeveloping Workflow Tasks\nLambda Functions\nDockerization\n\n\nWorkflow Configuration How-to's\n\n\nTasks\nCumulus API\nBackup and Restore\nEMS Reporting\n\nLocal Docs\n\nAdding a task\n\n\nUpgrade Instructions\n1.6.0\n1.7.0\n\n\nChangelog\nTeam\n\nData Cookbook\n\nAbout Cookbooks\nHelloWorldWorkflow\nSNS Configuration\n\n"},"architecture.html":{"url":"architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Cumulus Architecture\nBelow, find a diagram with the components that comprise an instance of Cumulus.\n\nWhile the internals are complex, the boxes represent components which are easy to understand:\n\nEvery Cumulus application requires it's own Cumulus deployment (lower left corner)\nEvery Cumulus deployment comes with:\nDynamoDB and ElasticSearch datastores\nan API Gateway for managing collections, providers, granules and other Cumulus resources, and,\ninternal lambda functions and queues for managing Cumulus workflows\n\n\nEvery Cumulus application should define a set of workflows, which are deployed as AWS Step Functions along with all other AWS Cumulus resources.\n\nDeveloping a Cumulus Application\nCumulus is a collection of resources for Cumulus developers.

Can be excluded if you are not exporting metadata to CMR.\n\nEarthData Client login username and password. User must have the ability to administer and/or create applications in URS.   It's recommended to obtain an account in the test environment (UAT).\n\n\nNeeded Git Repositories:\n\nCumulus\nCumulus Dashboard\nDeployment Template\n\nInstallation\nMake local copy of Cumulus Repo and prepare it.\nClone repository\n$ git clone https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus.git\nChange directory to the repository root\n$ cd cumulus\nOptionally, If you are deploying a particular version(tag), ref or branch of Cumulus core, you should check out that particular reference\n$ git checkout \\\nInstall and configure the local build environment and dependencies using npm\n$ nvm use\n$ npm install\n$ npm run ybootstrap\nBuild the Cumulus application\n$ npm run build\nPrepare DAAC deployment repository \nIf you already are working with an existing -deploy repository that is configured appropriately for the version of Cumulus you intend to deploy or update, skip to Prepare AWS configuration. \nClone template-deploy repo and name appropriately for your DAAC or organization\n$ git clone https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/template-deploy -deploy\nEnter repository root directory\n$ cd -deploy\nPackages are installed with npm. A list of Cumulus packages with descriptions and version information can be found here.\nIf you're trying to work with a certain version of a cumulus package or task, the version can be specified in package.json under dependencies. We use semantic versioning (major/minor/patch). You can also configure for automatic updates. Use ^ to update minor/patch versions automatically and ~ to automatically update patch versions. For example:\n\"@cumulus/sync-granule\": \"^1.0.0\"\nThen run:\n$ npm install\nTo add a new package, install via npm. Without a version specified, it will automatically install the latest version. For example:\n$ npm install @cumulus/deployment\nNote: The npm install command will add the kes utility to the -deploy's node_packages directory and will be utilized later for most of the AWS deployment commands\nTo use the specific version of the package installed during deployment, point the source key in the lambda config to node_modules/@cumulus//dist. This location may vary between packages, so consult the README in each. For example:\nSyncGranule:\n  source: 'node_modules/@cumulus/sync-granule/dist/'\nThe Cumulus project contains default configuration values in cumulus/packages/deployment/app.example, however these need to be customized for your Cumulus app.\nCopy the sample template into your repository \nBegin by copying the template directory to your project. You will modify it for your DAAC's specific needs later.\n$ cp -r ../cumulus/packages/deployment/app.example ./app\nOptional: Create a new repository -deploy so that you can track your DAAC's configuration changes:\n$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/-deploy\n$ git push origin master\nYou can then add/commit changes as needed.\nPrepare AWS configuration  \nSet Access Keys:\nYou need to make some AWS information available to your environment. If you don't already have the access key and secret access key of an AWS user with IAM Create-User permissions, you must Create Access Keys for such a user with IAM Create-User permissions, then export the access keys:\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\n$ export AWS_REGION=\nIf you don't want to set environment variables, access keys can be stored locally via the AWS CLI.\nCreate S3 Buckets:\nSee creating s3 buckets for more information on how to create a bucket.\nThe following s3 bucket should be created (replacing prefix with whatever you'd like, generally your organization/DAAC's name):\n\n-internal\n\nYou can create additional s3 buckets based on the needs of your workflows.\nThese buckets do not need any non-default permissions to function with Cumulus, however your local security requirements may vary.\nNote: s3 bucket object names are global and must be unique across all accounts/locations/etc.\n\nConfigure and Deploy the IAM stack\nConfigure deployment with -deploy/iam/config.yml\nThe iam configuration creates 4 roles and an instance profile used internally by the Cumulus stack.\nThe various config fields are described below with a sample config.yml at the end.\n\niam-deployment-name:\nThe name (e.g. dev) of the the 'deployment' - this key tells kes which configuration set (in addition to the default values) to use when creating the cloud formation template4\nprefix:\nThis value will prefix CloudFormation-created IAM resources and permissions.\nThe cumulus stack name must start with  5\nstackName:\nThe name of this iam stack in CloudFormation (e.g. -iam).\nbuckets:\nThe buckets created in the Create S3 Buckets step.\n\nSample new deployment added to config.yml:\n:          # e.g. dev (Note: Omit brackets, i.e. NOT )\n  prefix:   # prefixes CloudFormation-created iam resources and permissions\n  stackName:  # name of this iam stack in CloudFormation (e.g. -iams)\n  buckets:\n    internal: -internal  # Note: these are the bucket names, not the prefix from above\nDeploy iam stack1\n$ kes cf deploy --kes-folder iam --deployment  --template node_modules/@cumulus/deployment/iam --region \nNote: If this deployment fails check the deployment details in the AWS Cloud Formation Console for information. Permissions may need to be updated by your AWS administrator.\nIf the iam deployment command  succeeds, you should see 4 new roles in the IAM Console:\n\n-ecs\n-lambda-api-gateway\n-lambda-processing\n-steprole\n\nThe same information can be obtained from the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-roles.\nThe iam deployment also creates an instance profile named -ecs that can be viewed from the AWS CLI command: aws iam list-instance-profiles.\nUpdate AWS Access Keys\nCreate or obtain Access Keys for the user who will assume the DeployerRole in IAM, then export the access keys, replacing the previous values in your environment:\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\n$ export AWS_REGION=\nIf you don't want to set environment variables, access keys can be stored locally via the AWS CLI..\nMake sure you've updated your actual environment variables before proceeding (e.g., if sourcing from a file, re-source the file).\n\nConfigure and Deploy the Cumulus stack\nThese updates configure the copied template from the cumulus repository for your DAAC.\nYou should either add a new root-level key for your configuration or modify the existing default configuration key to whatever you'd like your new deployment to be.\nIf you're re-deploying based on an existing configuration you can skip this configuration step unless values have been updated or you'd like to add a new deployment to your deployment configuration file.\nEdit the  -deploy/app/config.yml file \nThe various configuration sections are described below with a sample config.yml at the end:\n\ncumulus-deployment-name:\nThe name (e.g. dev) of the the 'deployment' - this key tells kes which configuration set (in addition to the default values) to use when creating the cloud formation template4\nstackName:\nThe name of this stack in CloudFormation (e.g. ).    This stack name must start with the prefix listed in the IAM role configuration, or the deployment will fail.\nstackNameNoDash:\nA representation of the stack name that has dashes removed. This will be used for components that should be associated with the stack but do not allow dashes in the identifier.\nvpc\nConfigure your virtual private cloud.  You can find  and  values on the VPC Dashboard. vpcId from Your VPCs, and subnets here. When you choose a subnet, be sure to also note its availability zone, to configure ecs.\necs\nConfiguration for the Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) instance.  Update availabilityZone (or availabilityZones if using multiple AZs) with information from VPC Dashboard\nnote instanceType and desiredInstances have been selected for a sample install.  You will have to specify appropriate values to deploy and use ECS machines.   See EC2 Instance Types for more information.\nAlso note, if you dont specify the amiid, it will try to use a default, which may or may not exist.\nbuckets\nThe config buckets should map to the same names you used when creating buckets in the Prepare AWS step.\niams\nAdd the ARNs for each of the four roles and one instanceProfile created in the Create IAM Roles step.

You must create and register a new application. Use the User Acceptance Tools (UAT) site unless you changed urs_url above. Follow the directions on how to register an application..  Use any url for the Redirect URL, it will be deleted in a later step. Also note the password in step 3 and client ID in step 4 use these to replace clientid and clientpassword in the .env file in the next step.\nSet up an environment file:\nIf you're adding a new deployment to an existing configuration repository or re-deploying an existing Cumulus configuration you should skip to Deploy the Cumulus Stack, as these values should already be configured.\nCopy app/.env.sample to app/.env and add CMR/earthdata client credentials:\nCMR_PASSWORD=cmrpassword\nEARTHDATA_CLIENT_ID=clientid\nEARTHDATA_CLIENT_PASSWORD=clientpassword\nFor security it is highly recommended that you prevent apps/.env from being accidentally committed to the repository by keeping it in the .gitignore file at the root of this repository.\nDeploy\nOnce the preceding configuration steps have completed, run the following to deploy Cumulus from your -deploy root directory:\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/kes cf deploy --kes-folder app --region  \\\n  --template node_modules/@cumulus/deployment/app \\\n  --deployment \nYou can monitor the progess of the stack deployment from the AWS CloudFormation Console; this step takes a few minutes.\nA successful completion will result in output similar to:\n $ ./node_modules/.bin/kes cf deploy --kes-folder app --region \n   --template node_modules/@cumulus/deployment/app --deployment daac\nGenerating keys.

Then under Manage -> redirect URIs, add the Backend API url returned from the stack deployment, e.g. https://.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/token.\nAlso add the Distribution url https://.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/redirect3. You may also delete the placeholder url you used to create the application.\nIf you've lost track of the needed redirect URIs, they can be located on the API Gateway.  Once there select -backend and/or -distribution, Dashboard and utilizing the base URL at the top of the page that is accompanied by the text Invoke this API at:.   Make sure to append /token for the backend URL and /redirect to the distribution URL.\n\nDeploy Cumulus dashboard\nPrepare AWS\nCreate S3 bucket for dashboard:\n\nCreate it, e.g. -dashboard. Use the command line or console as you did when preparing AWS configuration.\nConfigure the bucket to host a website:\nAWS S3 console: Select -dashboard bucket then, \"Properties\" -> \"Static Website Hosting\", point to index.html\nCLI: aws s3 website s3://-dashboard --index-document index.html\n\n\nThe bucket's url will be http://-dashboard.s3-website-.amazonaws.com or you can find it on the AWS console via \"Properties\" -> \"Static website hosting\" -> \"Endpoint\"\nEnsure the bucket's access permissions allow your deployment user access to write to the bucket\n\n\n\nInstall dashboard\nTo install the dashboard clone the Cumulus-dashboard repository into the root deploy directory and install dependencies with npm install:\n$ git clone https://github.com/cumulus-nasa/cumulus-dashboard\n$ cd cumulus-dashboard\n$ npm install\nDashboard configuration\nConfigure dashboard:\nUpdate config in cumulus-dashboard/app/scripts/config/config.js:\nreplace the default apiRoot https://wjdkfyb6t6.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ with your app's apiroot.2\napiRoot: process.env.APIROOT || 'https://.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/'\nNote  environmental variables are available during the build: APIROOT, DAAC_NAME, STAGE, HIDE_PDR, any of these can be set on the command line to override the values contained in config.js when running the build below.\nBuild the dashboard from the dashboard repository root directory, cumulus-dashboard:\n  $ npm run build\nDashboard deployment:\nDeploy dashboard to s3 bucket from the cumulus-dashboard directory:\nUsing AWS CLI:\n  $ aws s3 sync dist s3://-dashboard --acl public-read\nFrom the S3 Console:\n\nOpen the -dashboard bucket, click 'upload'. Add the contents of the 'dist' subdirectory to the upload. Then select 'Next'. On the permissions window allow the public to view. Select 'Upload'.\n\nYou should be able to visit the dashboard website at http://-dashboard.s3-website-.amazonaws.com or find the url\n-dashboard -> \"Properties\" -> \"Static website hosting\" -> \"Endpoint\" and login with a user that you configured for access in the Configure Cumulus Stack step.\n\nUpdating Cumulus deployment\nOnce deployed for the first time, any future updates to the role/stack configuration files/version of Cumulus can be deployed and will update the appropriate portions of the stack as needed.\nUpdate roles\n$ kes cf deploy --kes-folder iam --deployment  \\\n  --region  # e.g. us-east-1\nCumulus Versioning\nCumulus uses a global versioning approach, meaning version numbers are consistent across all packages and tasks, and semantic versioning to track major, minor, and patch version (i.e. 1.0.0). We use Lerna to manage versioning. Any change will force lerna to increment the version of all packages.\nPublishing to NPM\n$ lerna publish\nTo specify the level of change for the new version\n$ lerna publish --cd-version (major | minor | patch | prerelease)\nUpdate Cumulus\n$ kes cf deploy --kes-folder config --region  \\\n  --deployment \nFootnotes:\n\n1. The iam  actions require more permissions than a typical AWS user will have and should be run by an administrator. ↩\n\n\n2. The API root can be found a number of ways. The easiest is to note it in the output of the app deployment step. But you can also find it from the AWS console -> Amazon API Gateway -> APIs -> -cumulus-backend -> Dashboard, and reading the url at the top \"invoke this API\" ↩\n\n\n3.

Use at your own risk.\nDeploy Cumulus\nInstallation\nIssues:\n\nIf you have a PEM_read_bio error when bootstrapping, SSL certificates may be to blame\n\nConfigure Cumulus Stack\nvpc\nIssues:\n\nIf redeploying an existing configuration you may already have at least 1 vpc associated with your existing deployment, but its subnets can be transitory in nature depending on what kind of load balancing and/or docker activities are taking place at a given time.  You should  identify at least one persistent subnet to use as a subnet ID (you may only specify one) for use.    If this is needed, navigate to  AWS EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups and note the \"Availability Zone\" (e.g., us-east-1a). Next, visit AWS VPC and click on \"Subnets\". Copy the 'VPC' value into 'vpcId' and the appropriate 'Subnet ID' value, based on the Availability Zone value you just saw on the Auto Scaling Groups page, into 'subnets'. If you have no vpc and/or subnets, do not include the vpc section in your new configuration.\n\nDeploy the Cumulus Stack\nMonitoring the progress of stack deployment can be done from the AWS CloudFormation Console.\nIssues:\n\nError: \"The availability zones of the specified subnets and the Auto Scaling group do not match\" -- see vpc issues\n\nThe deployment isn't failing but is taking a long time, navigate to AWS ECS and then to \"Clusters\". Identify the new cluster associated with your  app deployment and click on it. The summary table (shown at bottom) for the cluster probably says \"Desired tasks 1\", or some other non-zero number, and \"Running tasks 0\". Click Update, then update the cluster to change \"Number of tasks\" to 0, or else you will receive (eventually) an error such as \"Service arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:numbers:service/-cumulus- did not stabilize\" and your app deployment will fail.\n\nIf AWS stack rollback/deletion fails , check for a failure to delete named State Machines that this stack created. The names of the specific state machines can be gathered from the \"Events\" section of the stack's output on the AWS CloudFormation Console; you can then (carefully) manually delete the specified State Machines, thus readying AWS for the next attempt.\n\n\nInstall dashboard\nDashboard configuration\nIssues:\n\nProblem clearing the cache: EACCES: permission denied, rmdir '/tmp/gulp-cache/default'\", this probably means the files at that location, and/or the folder, are owned by someone else (or some other factor prevents you from writing there).\nIt's possible to workaround this by editing the file cumulus-dashboard/node_modules/gulp-cache/index.js and alter the value of the line var fileCache = new Cache({cacheDirName: 'gulp-cache'}); to something like var fileCache = new Cache({cacheDirName: '-cache'});. Now gulp-cache will be able to write to /tmp/-cache/default, and the error should resolve.\n\n\nDashboard deployment\nIssues:\n\nIf the dashboard sends you to an Earthdata Login page that has an error reading \"Invalid request, please verify the client status or redirect_uri before resubmitting\", this means you've either forgotten to update one or more of your EARTHDATA_CLIENT_ID, EARTHDATA_CLIENT_PASSWORD environment variables (from your app/.env file) and re-deploy Cumulus, or you haven't placed the correct values in theml, or you've forgotten to add both the \"redirect\" and \"token\" URL to the Earthdata Application.\n\nThere is odd caching behavior associated with the dashboard and Earthdata Login at this point in time that can cause the above error to reappear on the Earthdata Login page loaded by the dashboard even after fixing the cause of the error. If you experience this, attempt to access the dashboard in a new browser window, and it should work.\n\n\n"},"workflows/":{"url":"workflows/","title":"What are Cumulus Workflows?","keywords":"","body":"Workflows\nWorkflows are comprised of one or more AWS Lambda Functions and ECS Activities to discover, ingest, process, manage and archive data.\nProvider data ingest and GIBS have a set of common needs in getting data from a source system and into the cloud where they can be distributed to end users. These common needs are:\n\nData Discovery - Crawling, polling, or detecting changes from a variety of sources.\nData Transformation - Taking data files in their original format and extracting and transforming them into another desired format such as visible browse images.\nArchival - Storage of the files in a location that's accessible to end users.\n\nThe high level view of the architecture and many of the individual steps are the same but the details of ingesting each type of collection differs. Different collection types and different providers have different needs. The individual boxes of a workflow are not only different. The branching, error handling, and multiplicity of the arrows connecting the boxes are also different. Some need visible images rendered from component data files from multiple collections. Some need to contact the CMR with updated metadata. Some will have different retry strategies to handle availability issues with source data systems.\nAWS and other cloud vendors provide an ideal solution for parts of these problems but there needs to be a higher level solution to allow the composition of AWS components into a full featured solution. The Ingest Workflow Architecture is designed to meet the needs for Earth Science data ingest and transformation.\nGoals\nFlexibility and Composability\nThe steps to ingest and process data is different for each collection within a provider. Ingest should be as flexible as possible in the rearranging of steps and configuration.\nWe want to use lego-like individual steps that can be composed by an operator.\nIndividual steps should ...\n\nbe as ignorant as possible of the overall flow. They should not be aware of previous steps.\nbe runnable on their own.\ndefine their input and output in simple data structures.\nbe domain agnostic.\nDon't make assumptions of specifics of what goes into a granule for example.\n\n\n\nScalable\nThe ingest architecture needs to be scalable both to handle ingesting hundreds of millions of granules and interpret dozens of different workflows.\nData Provenance\n\nWe should have traceability for how data was produced and where it comes from.\nUse immutable representations of data. Data once received is not overwritten. Data can be removed for cleanup.\nAll software is versioned. We can trace transformation of data by tracking the immutable source data and the versioned software applied to it.\n\nOperator Visibility and Control.\n\nOperators should be able to see and understand everything that is happening in the system.\nIt should be obvious why things are happening and straightforward to diagnose problems.\nWe generally assume that the operators know best in terms of the limits on a providers infrastructure, how often things need to be done, and details of a collection. The architecture should defer to their decisions and knowledge while providing safety nets to prevent problems.\n\nA Reconfigurable Workflow Architecture\nThe Ingest Workflow Architecture is defined by two entity types, Workflows and Tasks. A Workflow is a set of composed Tasks to complete an objective such as ingesting a granule. Tasks are the individual steps of a Workflow that perform one job. The workflow is responsible for executing the right task based on the current state and response from the last task executed. Tasks are completely decoupled in that they don't call each other or even need to know about the presence of other tasks.\nWorkflows and tasks are configured via a JSON configuration file. A scheduler initiates workflows as configured by that JSON file.\n\nSee the Example GIBS Ingest Architecture showing how workflows and tasks are used to define the GIBS Ingest Architecture.\nWorkflows\nA workflow is a provider configured set of steps that describe the process to ingest data. Workflows are defined using AWS Step Functions.\nBenefits of AWS Step Functions\nAWS Step functions are described in detail in the AWS documentation but they provide several benefits which are applicable to AWS.\n\nPrebuilt solution\nOperations Visibility\nVisual diagram\nEvery execution is recorded with both inputs and output for every step.\n\n\nComposability\nAllow composing AWS Lambdas and code running in other steps. Code can be run in EC2 to interface with it or even on premise if desired.\nStep functions allow specifying when steps run in parallel or choices between steps based on data from the previous step.\n\n\nFlexibility\nStep functions are designed to be easy to build new applications and reconfigure. We're exposing that flexibility directly to the provider.\n\n\nReliability and Error Handling\nStep functions allow configuration of retries and adding handling of error conditions.\n\n\nDescribed via data\nThis makes it easy to save the step function in configuration management solutions.\nWe can build simple interfaces on top of the flexibility provided.\n\n\n\nWorkflow Scheduler\nThe scheduler is responsible for initiating a step function and passing in the relevant data for a collection. This is currently configured as an interval for each collection. The Scheduler service creates the initial event by combining the collection configuration with the AWS execution context provided by its CloudFormation template.\nTasks\nA workflow is composed of tasks. Each task is responsible for performing a discrete step of the ingest process. These can be activities like:\n\nCrawling a provider website for new data.\nUploading data from a provider to S3.\nExecuting a process to transform data.\n\nAWS Step Functions permit tasks to be code running anywhere, even on premise. We expect most tasks will be written as Lambda functions in order to take advantage of the easy deployment, scalability, and cost benefits provided by AWS Lambda.\n\nLeverages Existing Work\nThe design leverages the existing work of Amazon by defining workflows using the AWS Step Function State Language. This is the language that was created for describing the state machines used in AWS Step Functions.\n\n\nOpen for Extension\nBoth meta and workflow_config which are used for configuring at the collection and task levels do not dictate the fields and structure of the configuration. Additional task specific JSON schemas can be used for extending the validation of individual steps.\n\n\nData-centric Configuration\nThe use of a single JSON configuration file allows this to be added to a workflow. We build additional support on top of the configuration file for simpler domain specific configuration or interactive GUIs.\n\n\n\nSee the Configuration File Schema.\nFor more details on Task Messages and Configuration, visit Cumulus Configuration and Message Protocol.\nIngest Deploy\nTo view deployment documentation, please see Deployment of Cumulus Documentation.\nRisks, Tradeoffs, and Benefits\nThis section documents various risks, tradeoffs, and benefits of the Ingest Workflow Architecture.\nRisks\nThis section documents potential risks and mitigations of the Ingest Workflow Architecture.\nAWS Step Functions are relatively new.\nAWS Step Functions were introduced and made public on December 1, 2016. As a newer service in AWS this could mean that they have reliability issues or may undergo changing. There are several reasons why this risk may not be significant.\n\nAWS Step Functions is the next version of an older service Simple Workflow Service (SWS) built by the same team. It incorporates lessons learned from the previous one. SWS is now deprecated by AWS.\nIn an introductory video, AWS stated that they've been using Step Functions internally before release.\nTasks are built on older technologies. Even the newest one, Lambda is several years old.\n\nMissing features is likely to be encountered. We found there is now built in For-Each capability. We can work around problems like this, as shown in the GIBS Ingest Architecture by splitting the workflow. This does increase the complexity of the overall solution by requiring more workflow definitions.\nTradeoffs\nWorkflow execution is handled completely by AWS.\nThis means we can't add our own code into the orchestration of the workflow. We can't add new features not supported by Step Functions. We can't do things like enforce that the responses from tasks always conform to a schema or extract the configuration for a task ahead of it's execution.\nIf we implemented our own orchestration we'd be able to add all of these. We save significant amounts of development effort and gain all the features of Step Functions for this trade off. One workaround is by providing a library of common task capabilities. These would optionally be available to tasks that can be implemented with Node.js and are able to include the library.\nWorkflow Configuration is specified in AWS Step Function States Language\nThe current design combines the states language defined by AWS with Ingest specific configuration. This means our representation has a tight coupling with their standard. If they make backwards incompatible changes in the future we will have to deal with existing projects written against that.\nWe avoid having to develop our own standard and code to process it. The design can support new features in AWS Step Functions without needing to update the Ingest library code changes. It is unlikely they will make a backwards incompatible change at this point. One mitigation for this is writing data transformations to a new format if that were to happen.\nCollection Configuration Flexibility vs Complexity\nThe Collections Configuration File is very flexible but requires more knowledge of AWS step functions to configure. A person modifying this file directly would need to comfortable editing a JSON file and configuring AWS Step Functions state transitions which address AWS resources.\nThe configuration file itself is not necessarily meant to be edited by a human directly. Since we are developing a reconfigurable, composable architecture that specified entirely in data additional tools can be developed on top of it. The existing recipes.json files can be mapped to this format. Operational Tools like a GUI can be built that provide a usable interface for customizing workflows but it will take time to develop these tools.\nBenefits\nThis section describes benefits of the Ingest Workflow Architecture.\nSimplicity\nThe concepts of Workflows and Tasks are simple ones that should make sense to providers. Additionally, the implementation will only consist of a few components because the design leverages existing services and capabilities of AWS. The Ingest implementation will only consist of some reusable task code to make task implementation easier, Ingest deployment, and the Workflow Scheduler.\nComposability\nThe design aims to satisfy the needs for ingest integrating different workflows for providers. It's flexible in terms of the ability to arrange tasks to meet the needs of a collection. Providers have developed and incorporated open source tools over the years. All of these are easily integrable into the workflows as tasks.\nThere is low coupling between task steps. Failures of one component don't bring the whole system down. Individual tasks can be deployed separately.\nScalability\nAWS Step Functions scale up as needed and aren't limited by a set of number of servers. They also easily allow you to leverage the inherent scalability of serverless functions.\nMonitoring and Auditing\n\nEvery execution is captured.\nEvery task run has captured input and outputs.\nCloudWatch Metrics can be used for monitoring many of the events with the StepFunctions. It can also generate alarms for the whole process.\nVisual report of the entire configuration.\nErrors and success states are highlighted visually in the flow.\n\n\n\nData Provenance\n\nMonitoring and auditing ensures we know the data that was given to a task.\nWorkflows are versioned and the state machines stored in AWS Step Functions are immutable. Once created they cannot change.\nVersioning of data in S3 or using immutable records in S3 will mean we always know what data was created as the result of a step or fed into a step.\n\nAppendix\nExample GIBS Ingest Architecture\nThis shows the GIBS Ingest Architecture as an example of the use of the Ingest Workflow Architecture.\n\nThe GIBS Ingest Architecture consists of two workflows per collection type. There is one for discovery and one for ingest. The final stage of discovery triggers multiple ingest workflows for each MRF granule that needs to be generated.\nIt demonstrates both lambdas as tasks and a container used for MRF generation.\n\nGIBS Ingest Workflows\n\nGIBS Ingest Granules Workflow\nThis shows a visualization of an execution of the ingets granules workflow in step functions.

The same format is used for input and output from workflow steps. The common format consists of a JSON object which holds all necessary information about the task execution and AWS environment. Tasks return objects identical in format to their input with the exception of a task-specific \"payload\" field. Tasks may also augment their execution metadata.\nCumulus Message Adapter\nThe Cumulus Message Adapter and Cumulus Message Adapter libraries help task developers integrate their tasks into a Cumulus workflow. These libraries adapt input and outputs from tasks into the Cumulus Message format. The Scheduler service creates the initial event by combining the collection configuration, external resource configuration, workflow configuration, and deployment environment settings.  The subsequent workflow messages between tasks must conform to the message schema. By using the Cumulus Message Adapter, individual task Lambda functions only receive the input and output specifically configured for the task, and not non-task-related message fields.\nThe Cumulus Message Adapter libraries are called by the tasks with a callback function containing the business logic of the task as a parameter. They first adapt the incoming message to a format more easily consumable by Cumulus tasks, then invoke the task, and then adapt the task response back to the Cumulus message protocol to be sent to the next task.  \nA task's Lambda function can include a Cumulus Message Adapter library which constructs input/output messages and resolves task configurations. In the Lambda function configuration file lambdas.yml, a task Lambda function can be configured to use Cumulus Message Adapter, for example:\nDiscoverPdrs:\n  handler: index.handler\n  useMessageAdapter: true  \nInput to task application code is a json object with keys:\n\ninput: By default, the incoming payload is the payload from previous task, or it can be a portion of the payload as specified in the task configuration.\nconfig: Task-specific configuration object with URL templates resolved.\n\nOutput of the task application code:\n\nTask output: By default, the task's return value is the next payload, or a portion of it is interpreted as the next payload as specified in the task configuration.\n\nCumulus Message Adapter has the following steps:\n1. Resolve URL templates in the task configuration\nIn the workflow configuration, each task has its own configuration, and it can use URL template as a value to achieve simplicity or for values only available at execution time. The Cumulus Message Adapter resolves the URL templates and then passes message to next task. For example, given a task which has the following configuration:\nDiscovery:\n    CumulusConfig:\n      provider: '{$.meta.provider}'\n      inlinestr: 'prefix{meta.foo}suffix'\n      array: '[$.meta.foo]'\n      object: '{$.meta}'\nThe corresponding Cumulus Message would be:\n{\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"foo\": \"bar\",\n    \"provider\": {\n      \"id\": \"FOO_DAAC\",\n      \"anykey\": \"anyvalue\"\n    },\n    ...\n  },\n  \"workflow_config\": {\n    \"Discovery\": {\n      \"object\": \"{{$.meta.provider}}\",\n      \"inlinestr\": \"prefix{meta.foo}suffix\",\n      \"array\": \"{[$.meta.foo]}\"\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n}\nThe message sent to the task would be:\n{\n  \"config\" : {\n    \"useQueue\": true,\n    \"object\": {\n      \"id\": \"FOO_DAAC\",\n      \"anykey\": \"anyvalue\"\n    },\n    \"inlinestr\": \"prefixbarsuffix\",\n    \"array\": [\"bar\"]\n  },\n  \"input\":{...}\n}  \nURL template variables replace dotted paths inside curly brackets with their corresponding value. If the Cumulus Message Adapter cannot resolve a value, it will ignore the template, leaving it verbatim in the string.  While seemingly complex, this allows significant decoupling of Tasks from one another and the data that drives them. Tasks are able to easily receive runtime configuration produced by previously run tasks and domain data.\n2. Resolve task input\nBy default, the incoming payload is the payload from the previous task.  The task can also be configured to use a portion of the payload its input message.  For example, given a task specifies cumulus_message.input:\nExampleTask:\n  CumulusConfig:\n    cumulus_message:\n        input: '{$.payload.foo}'\nThe task configuration in the message would be:\n{\n  \"workflow_config\": {\n    \"ExampleTask\": {\n      \"cumulus_message\": {\n        \"input\": \"{{$.payload.foo}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"foo\": {\n      \"anykey\": \"anyvalue\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe Cumulus Message Adapter will resolve the task input, instead of sending the whole \"payload\" as task input, the task input would be:\n{\n  \"input\" : {\n    \"anykey\": \"anyvalue\"\n  },\n  \"config\": {...}\n}\n3. Resolve task output\nBy default, the task's return value is the next payload.  However, the workflow task configuration can specify a portion of the return value as the next payload, and can also augment values to other fields. Based on the task configuration under cumulus_message.outputs, the Message Adapter uses a task's return value to output a message as configured by the task-specific config defined under workflow_config. The Message Adapter dispatches a \"source\" to a \"destination\" as defined by URL templates stored in the task-specific cumulus_message.outputs. The value of the task's return value at the \"source\" URL is used to create or replace the value of the task's return value at the \"destination\" URL. For example, given a task specifies cumulus_message.output in its workflow configuration as follows:\nExampleTask:\n  CumulusConfig:\n    cumulus_message:\n        outputs: \n          - source: '{$}'\n            destination: '{$.payload}'\n          - source: '{$.output.anykey}'\n            destination: '{$.meta.baz}'\nThe corresponding Cumulus Message would be:\n{\n  \"workflow_config\": {\n    \"ExampleTask\": {\n      \"cumulus_message\": {\n        \"outputs\": [\n          {\n            \"source\": \"{{$}}\",\n            \"destination\": \"{{$.payload}}\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"source\": \"{{$.output.anykey}}\",\n            \"destination\": \"{{$.meta.baz}}\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\n  },\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"anykey\": \"anyvalue\"\n  }\n}\nGiven the response from the task is:\n{\n  \"output\": {\n      \"anykey\": \"boo\"\n  }\n}\nThe Cumulus Message Adapter would output the following Cumulus Message:\n{\n  \"workflow_config\": {\n    \"ExampleTask\": {\n      \"cumulus_message\": {\n        \"outputs\": [\n          {\n            \"source\": \"{{$}}\",\n            \"destination\": \"{{$.payload}}\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"source\": \"{{$.output.anykey}}\",\n            \"destination\": \"{{$.meta.baz}}\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"foo\": \"bar\",\n    \"baz\": \"boo\"\n  },\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"output\": {\n      \"anykey\": \"boo\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n4. Validate task input, output and configuration messages against the schemas provided.\nThe Cumulus Message Adapter has the capability to validate task input, output and configuration messages against their schemas.  The default location of the schemas is the schemas folder in the top level of the task and the default filenames are input.json, output.json, and config.json. The task can also configure a different schema location.  If no schema can be found, the Cumulus Message Adapter will not validate the messages.\nCommon Data Types\nRemote Urls\nInput to: sync-http-urls\nReturned by: discover-http-tiles, sync-wms\n// Array of remote URLs\n{\n     \"url\": \"\",     // A single remote URL\n     \"version\": \"\"  // An opaque string that identifies the remote file version.\n                            // This can be used to allow re-fetching of remote resources if\n                            // the change but still have the same URL\n},\n...                         // Potentially more URLs\nS3 Objects\nProduced by: sync-http-urls\nInput to: generate-mrf\n// Array of S3 objects\n{\n    \"Bucket\": \"\",  // The S3 bucket.

Cumulus Tasks permit a payload as input to the main task application code. The task payload is additionally wrapped by the Cumulus Message Adapter. The Cumulus Message Adapter supplies additional information supporting message templating and metadata management of these workflows.\n\nThe steps in this flow are detailed in sections below.\nCumulus Message Format\nCumulus Messages come in 2 flavors: The full Cumulus Message and the Cumulus Remote Message. The Cumulus Remote Message points to a full Cumulus Message stored in S3 because of size limitations.\nA full Cumulus Message has the 4 following keys:\n\nworkflow_config: Definition-time information to set up tasks. Optionally includes configuration for each task in the workflow, keyed by task name.\ncumulus_meta: System runtime information that should generally not be touched outside of Cumulus library code or the Cumulus Message Adapter. Stores meta information about the workflow such as the state machine name and the current workflow execution's name. This information is used to look up the current active task. The name of the current active task is used to look up the corresponding task's config in workflow_config.\nmeta: Runtime information captured by the workflow operators. Stores execution-agnostic variables which can be re-used via templates in workflow_config.\npayload: Payload is runtime information for the tasks.\n\nHere's a simple example of a Cumulus Message:\n{\n  \"workflow_config\": {\n    \"Example\": {\n      \"inlinestr\": \"prefix{meta.foo}suffix\",\n      \"array\": \"{[$.meta.foo]}\",\n      \"object\": \"{{$.meta}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"cumulus_meta\": {\n    \"message_source\": \"sfn\",\n    \"state_machine\": \"arn:aws:states:us-east-1:1234:stateMachine:MySfn\",\n    \"execution_name\": \"MyExecution__id-1234\",\n    \"id\": \"id-1234\"\n  },\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\n  },\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"anykey\": \"anyvalue\"\n  }\n}\n\nA Cumulus Remote Message has only the keys replace and cumulus_meta.\n{\n  \"replace\": {\n    \"Bucket\": \"cumulus-bucket\",\n    \"Key\": \"my-large-event.json\"\n  },\n  \"cumulus_meta\": {}\n}\n\nCumulus Message Preparation\nThe event coming into a Cumulus Task is assumed to be a Cumulus Message or Cumulus Remote Message and should first be handled by the functions described below before being passed to the task application code.\nPreparation Step 1: Fetch remote event\nFetch remote event will fetch the full event from S3 if the cumulus message includes a replace key.\nOnce \"my-large-event.json\" is fetched from S3, it's returned from the fetch remote event function. If no \"replace\" key is present, the event passed to the fetch remote event function is assumed to be a full Cumulus Message and returned as-is.\nPreparation Step 2: Fetch step function config\nFetch step function config determines what current task is being executed. Note this is different from what lambda or activity is being executed, because the same lambda or activity can be used for different tasks. The current task name is used to load the appropriate configuration from the Cumulus Message's 'workflow_config'.\nPreparation Step 3: Load nested event\nUsing the config returned from the previous step, load nested event resolves templates for the final config and input to send to the task's application code. Read more on URL Templating in the Protocol section.\nTask Application Code\nAfter message prep, the message passed to the task application code is of the form:\n{\n  \"input\": {},\n  \"config\": {}\n}\n\nCreate Next Message functions\nWhatever comes out of the task application code is used to construct an outgoing Cumulus Message.\nCreate Next Message Step 1: Assign outputs\nThe config loaded from the Fetch step function config step may have a cumulus_message key. This can be used to \"dispatch\" fields from the task's application output to a destination in the final event output (via URL templating). Here's an example where the value of input.anykey would be dispatched as the value of payload.out in the final cumulus message:\n{\n  \"workflow_config\": {\n    \"Example\": {\n      \"bar\": \"baz\",\n      \"cumulus_message\": {\n        \"input\": \"{{$.payload.input}}\",\n        \"outputs\": [\n          {\n            \"source\": \"{{$.input.anykey}}\",\n            \"destination\": \"{{$.payload.out}}\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"cumulus_meta\": {\n    \"task\": \"Example\",\n    \"message_source\": \"local\",\n    \"id\": \"id-1234\"\n  },\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\n  },\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"input\": {\n      \"anykey\": \"anyvalue\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Next Message Step 2: Store remote event\nStore remote event complements Fetch remote event: If the cumulus message is too big, it will be stored in S3 and the final output of the task will be Cumulus Remove Message - an object with only the replace and cumulus_meta keys. The replace key identifies where the large event has been stored in S3.\n"},"workflows/developing-workflow-tasks.html":{"url":"workflows/developing-workflow-tasks.html","title":"Developing Workflow Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Developing Workflow Tasks\nWorkflow tasks can be either AWS Lambda Functions or ECS Activities.\nLambda functions\nYou can use one of the many @cumulus node modules to take advantage of common functionality for Cumulus workflows, such as @cumulus/parse-pdr and @cumulus/post-to-cmr.\nThe full set of available lambda functions can be found on npm: npmjs.com/org/cumulus and in source code: cumulus/tasks.\nYou can also develop your own lambda function, read more on the Lambda Functions page.\nECS Activities\nECS activities require a docker image.

These directories must exist.\n\nThe Docker Registry\nDocker images that are built can be stored in the cloud in a Docker registry. Currently we are using the AWS Docker Registry, called ECR. To access these images, you must first log in using your AWS credentials, and use AWS CLI to get the proper login string:\n# install awscli\n$ pip install awscli\n\n# login to the AWS Docker registry\n$ aws ecr get-login --region us-east-1 | source /dev/stdin\nAs long as you have permissions to access the NASA Cumulus AWS account, this will allow you to pull images from AWS ECR, and push rebuilt or new images there as well. Docker-compose may also be used to push images.\n$ docker-compose push\nWhich will push the built image to AWS ECR. Note that the image built by docker-compose will have is the :latest tag, and will overwrite the :latest tagged docker image on the registry.  This file should be updated to push to a different tag if overwriting is not desired.\nIn normal use-cases, though, CircleCI takes care of this building and deploying process, as far as production.\nSource Control and Versions\nAll the code necessary for processing a data collection, and the code used to create a Docker image for it, is contained within a single GitHub repository, following the naming convention docker-${dataname}, where dataname is the collection's short name. The git develop branch is the current development version, master is the latest release version, and a git tag exists for each tagged version (e.g., v0.1.3).\nDocker images can have multiple tagged versions. The Docker images in the registry follow this same convention. A Docker image tagged as 'develop' is an image of the development branch. 'latest' is the master brach, and thus the latest tagged version, with an additional tagged image for each version tagged in the git repository.\nThe generation of the released tagged images are created and deployed automatically with Circle-CI, the continuous integration system used by Cumulus. When new commits are merged into a branch, the appropriate Docker image is built, tested, and deployed to the Docker registry. More on testing below.\nDocker Images\ndocker-base\nDocker images are built in layers, allowing common dependencies to be shared to child Docker images. A base docker image is provided that includes some dependencies shared among the current HS3 data processing codes. This includes NetCDF liraries, AWS Cli, Python, Git, as well as py-cumulus, a collection of Python utilities that are used in the processing scripts. The docker-base repository is used to generate new images that are then stored in AWS ECR.\nThe docker-base image can be interacted with by running it in interactive mode (ie, docker run -it docker-base, since the default \"entrypoint\" to the image is a bash shell.\ndocker-data example: docker-hs3-avaps\nTo create a new processing stream for a data collection, a Dockerfile is used to specify what additional dependencies may be required, and to build them in that environment, if necessary. An example Dockerfile is shown here, for the hs3avaps collection.\n# cumulus processing Dockerfile: docker-hs3-avaps\n\nFROM 985962406024.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cumulus-base:latest\n\n# copy needed files\nWORKDIR /work\nCOPY . /work\n\nRUN apt-get install -y nco libhdf5-dev\n\n# compile code\nRUN gcc convert/hs3cpl2nc.c -o _convert -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial -L/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu -lnetcdf -lhdf5_serial\n\n# input and output directories will be Data Pipeline staging dir env vars\nENTRYPOINT [\"/work/process.py\"]\nCMD [\"input\", \"output\"]\nWhen this Dockerfile is built, docker will first use the latest cumulus-base image. It will then copy the entire GitHub repository (the processing required for a single data collection is a repository) to the /work directory which will now contain all the code necessary to process this data. In thie case, a C file is compiled to convert the supplied hdf5 files to NetCDF files. Note that this also requires installing the system libraries nco and libhdf5-dev via apt-get. Lastly, the Dockerfile sets the entrypoint to the processing handler, so that this command is run when the image is run. It expects two arguments to be handed to it: 'input' and 'output' meaning the input and output directories.\nProcess Handler\nAll of the processing is managed through a handler, which is called when the docker image is run. Currently, Python is used for the process handler, which provides a simple interface to perform validation, run shell commands, test the output generated, and log the output for us. The handler function takes two arguments: input directory and output directory. Any other needed parameters are set via environment variables. The handler function will process the input directory, and put any output to be saved in the output directory.\nPy-cumulus\nThe py-cumulus library provides some helper functions that can be used for logging, writing metadata, and testing. Py-cumulus is installed in the docker-base image. Currently, there are three modules:\nimport cumulus.logutils\nimport cumulus.metadata\nimport cumulus.process\nExample process handler\nAn example process handler is given here, in this case a shortened version of the hs3-cpl data collection. The main function at the bottom passes the provided input and output directory arguments to the process() function. The first thing process() does is to get the Cumulus logger. The Cumulus logger will send output to both stdout and Splunk, to be used in the Cumulus pipeline. Log strings are made using the make_log_string() function which properly formats a message to be handled by Splunk.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport glob\nimport re\nimport datetime\nimport subprocess\nfrom cumulus.logutils import get_logger, make_log_string\nfrom cumulus.metadata import write_metadata\nfrom cumulus.process import check_output\n\n# the main process handler\ndef process(indir, outdir):\n    \"\"\" Process this directory \"\"\"\n    log = get_logger()\n    log.info(\n        make_log_string(process='processing', message=\"Processing %s into %s\" % (indir, outdir))\n    )\n\n    dataname = 'cpl'\n    dataid = os.getenv('SHORT_NAME', 'hs3cpl')\n\n    for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(indir, '*.hdf5')):\n        bname = os.path.basename(f)\n        log.info(\n            make_log_string(granule_id=bname, process='processing', message=\"Processing started for %s\" % bname)\n        )\n\n        # convert file to netcdf\n        cmd = ['/work/_convert', f, outdir]\n        out = subprocess.check_output(cmd)\n        fout = glob.glob(os.path.join(outdir, 'HS3_%s*.nc' % bname[0:7]))\n        fout = '' if len(fout) == 0 else fout[0]\n        check_output(fout)\n        cmd = ['ncatted -h -a Conventions,global,c,c,\"CF-1.6\" %s' % fout]\n        out = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)\n        log.debug(out)\n\n        # write metadata output\n        write_metadata(fout, dataname=dataname, dataid=dataid, outdir=outdir)\n\n    # remove the generated metadata files\n    for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(outdir, '*.met')):\n        os.remove(f)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    indir = sys.argv[1]\n    outdir = sys.argv[2]\n    process(indir, outdir)\nAfter setting up logging the code has a for-loop for processing any matching hdf5 in the input directory: \n1) convert to NetCDF with a C script\n2) validate the output (in this case just check for existence) \n3) use 'ncatted' to update the resulting file to be CF-compliant\n4) write out metadata generated for this file\nProcess Testing\nIt is important to have tests for data processing, however in many cases datafiles can be large so it is not practical to store the test data in the repository. Instead, test data is currrently stored on AWS S3, and can be retrieved using the AWS CLI.\n$ aws s3 sync s3://cumulus-ghrc-logs/sample-data/collection-name data\nWhere collection-name is the name of the data collection, such as 'avaps', or 'cpl'.  For example, an abridged version of the data for CPL includes:\n├── cpl\n│   ├── input\n│   │   ├── HS3_CPL_ATB_12203a_20120906.hdf5\n│   │   ├── HS3_CPL_OP_12203a_20120906.hdf5\n│   └── output\n│       ├── HS3_CPL_ATB_12203a_20120906.nc\n│       ├── HS3_CPL_ATB_12203a_20120906.nc.meta.xml\n│       ├── HS3_CPL_OP_12203a_20120906.nc\n│       ├── HS3_CPL_OP_12203a_20120906.nc.meta.xml\nContained in the input directory are all possible sets of data files, while the output directory is the expected result of processing. In this case the hdf5 files are converted to NetCDF files and XML metadata files are generated.\nThe docker image for a process can be used on the retrieved test data. First create a test-output directory in the newly created data directory.\n$ mkdir data/test-output\nThen run the docker image using docker-compose.\n$ docker-compose run test\nThis will process the data in the data/input directory and put the output into data/test-output. Repositories also include Python based tests which will validate this newly created output to the contents of data/output. Use Python's Nose tool to run the included tests.\n$ nosetests\nIf the data/test-output directory validated against the contents of data/output the tests will be successful, otherwise an error will be reported.\n"},"workflows/workflow-configuration-how-to.html":{"url":"workflows/workflow-configuration-how-to.html","title":"Workflow Configuration How-to's","keywords":"","body":"Workflow Configuration How-To's\nHow to specify a bucket for granules\nHow to configure workflows.yml workflow configurations for specifying buckets.\nBucket configuration\nBuckets configured in app/config.yml will ultimately become part of the workflow configuration.type of a bucket relies on the how that bucket will be used.\npublic indicates a completely public bucket.\ninternal type is for system use.\nprotected buckets are for any information that should be behind an Earthdata Login authentication.\nprivate buckets are for private data.\nConsider this app/config.yml for all following examples:\nbuckets:\n  internal:\n    name: sample-internal-bucket\n    type: internal\n  private:\n    name: sample-private-bucket\n    type: private\n  protected:\n    name: sample-protected-bucket\n    type: protected\n  public:\n    name: sample-public-bucket\n    type: public\n  protected-2:\n    name: sample-protected-bucket-2\n    type: protected\nPoint to buckets in the workflow configuration\nBuckets specified in app/config.yml will become part of the meta object of the Cumulus message and can be accessed in your workflow configuration. \nTo use the buckets specified in your config, you can do the following:\nDiscoverGranules:\n      CumulusConfig:\n        provider: '{$.meta.provider}'\n        collection: '{$.meta.collection}'\n        buckets: '{$.meta.buckets}'\nMoveGranules:\n      CumulusConfig:\n        bucket: '{$.meta.buckets.internal.name}'\n        buckets: '{$.meta.buckets}'\nHardcode a bucket\nBucket names can be hardcoded in your workflow configuration, for example:\nDiscoverGranules:\n      CumulusConfig:\n        provider: '{$.meta.provider}'\n        collection: '{$.meta.collection}'\n        buckets:\n          internal: 'sample-internal-bucket'\n          protected: 'sample-protected-bucket-2'\nOr you can do a combination of meta buckets and hardcoded:\nDiscoverGranules:\n      CumulusConfig:\n        provider: '{$.meta.provider}'\n        collection: '{$.meta.collection}'\n        buckets:\n          internal: 'sample-internal-bucket'\n          private: '{$.meta.buckets.private.name}'\nUsing meta and hardcoding\nBucket names can be configured using a mixture of hardcoded values and values from the meta. For example, to configure the bucket based on the collection name you could do something like:\nDiscoverGranules:\n      CumulusConfig:\n        provider: '{$.meta.provider}'\n        collection: '{$.meta.collection}'\n        buckets:\n          internal: '{$.meta.collection.name}-bucket'\nHow to specify a file location in a bucket\nGranule files can be placed in folders and subfolders in buckets for better organization. This is done by setting a url_path in the base level of a collection configuration to be applied to all files. To only affect placement of a single file, the url_path variable can be placed in that specific file of the collection configuration. There are a number of different ways to populate url_path.\nHardcoding file placement\nA file path can be added as the url_path in the collection configuration to specify the final location of the files. For example, take the following collection configuration\n{\n  \"name\": \"MOD09GQ\",\n  \"version\": \"006\",\n  \"url_path\": \"example-path\",\n  \"files\": {\n    {\n      \"bucket\": \"protected\",\n      \"regex\": \"^MOD09GQ\\\\.A[\\\\d]{7}\\\\.[\\\\S]{6}\\\\.006.[\\\\d]{13}\\\\.hdf$\",\n      \"sampleFileName\": \"MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf\",\n      \"url_path\": \"file-example-path\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"bucket\": \"private\",\n      \"regex\": \"^MOD09GQ\\\\.A[\\\\d]{7}\\\\.[\\\\S]{6}\\\\.006.[\\\\d]{13}\\\\.hdf\\\\.met$\",\n      \"sampleFileName\": \"MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf.met\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe first file, MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf has its own url_path so the resulting file path might look like s3://sample-protected-bucket/file-example-path/MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf.\nThe second file, MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf.met, does not have it's own url_path so it will use the collection url_path and have a final file path of s3://sample-private-bucket/example-path/MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf.met.\nUsing a template for file placement\nInstead of hardcoding the placement, the url_path can be a template to be populated with metadata during the move-granules step. For example:\n\"url_path\": \"{cmrMetadata.Granule.Collection.ShortName}\"\nThis url path with be assigned as the collection shortname, \"MOD09GQ\".\nTo take a subset of any given metadata, use the option substring.\n\"url_path\": \"{cmrMetadata.Granule.Collection.ShortName}/{substring(file.name, 0, 3)}\"\nThis example will populate to \"MOD09GQ/MOD\"\nNote: the move-granules step needs to be in the workflow for this template to be populated and the file moved. This cmrMetadata or CMR granule XML needs to have been generated and stored on S3. From there any field could be retrieved and used for a url_path.\nAdding Metadata dates and times to the URL Path\nThere are a number of options to pull dates from the CMR file metadata. With this metadata:\n\n    \n        \n            2003-02-19T00:00:00Z\n            2003-02-19T23:59:59Z\n        \n    \n\nThe following examples of url_path could be used.\n{extractYear(cmrMetadata.Granule.Temporal.RangeDateTime.BeginningDateTime)} will pull the year from the full date: 2003.\n{extractMonth(cmrMetadata.Granule.Temporal.RangeDateTime.BeginningDateTime)} will pull the month: 2.\n{extractDate(cmrMetadata.Granule.Temporal.RangeDateTime.BeginningDateTime)} will pull the day: 19.\n{extractHour(cmrMetadata.Granule.Temporal.RangeDateTime.BeginningDateTime)} will pull the hour: 0.\nDifferent values can be combined to create the url_path. For example\n\"bucket\": \"sample-protected-bucket\",\n\"name\": \"MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf\",\n\"url_path\": \"{cmrMetadata.Granule.Collection.ShortName}/{extractYear(cmrMetadata.Granule.Temporal.RangeDateTime.BeginningDateTime)/extractDate(cmrMetadata.Granule.Temporal.RangeDateTime.BeginningDateTime)}\"\nThe final file location for the above would be s3://sample-protected-bucket/MOD09GQ/2003/19/MOD09GQ.A2017025.h21v00.006.2017034065104.hdf.\n"},"data_in_dynamodb.html":{"url":"data_in_dynamodb.html","title":"Cumulus Metadata in DynamoDB","keywords":"","body":"Cumulus Metadata in DynamoDB\n\nDynamoDB Backup and Restore\nDynamoDB Auto Scaling\n\n@cumulus/api uses a number of methods to preserve the metadata generated in a Cumulus instance.\nAll configurations and system-generated metadata is stored in DynamoDB tables except the logs. System logs are stored in the AWS CloudWatch service.\n@cumulus/api creates the following DynamoDB tables:\n\nUsers: api/dashboard users\nCollections: collection records \nProviders: provider records\nRules: rules for managing and running workflows\nExecutions: workflow executions (step function executions)\nGranules: granules processed by the Cumulus instance\nPDRs: PDRs processed in Cumulus\n\nAmazon DynamoDB stores three geographically distributed replicas of each table to enable high availability and data durability. Amazon DynamoDB runs exclusively on solid-state drives (SSDs). SSDs help AWS achieve the design goals of predictable low-latency response times for storing and accessing data at any scale.\nBackup and Restore with AWS\nYou can enable point-in-time recovery (PITR) as well as create an on-demand backup for your Amazon DynamoDB tables.\nPITR provides continuous backups of your DynamoDB table data. You can enable PITR with a single click from the AWS Management Console or a single API call. When enabled, DynamoDB maintains continuous backups of your table up to the last 35 days. You can recover a copy of that table to a previous state at any point in time from the moment you enable PITR, up to a maximum of the 35 preceding days. PITR provides continuous backups until you explicitly disable it.\nOn-demand backups allow you to create backups of DynamoDB table data and its settings. You can initiate an on-demand backup at any time with a single click from the AWS Management Console or a single API call. You can restore the backups to a new DynamoDB table in the same AWS Region at any time.\nPITR gives your DynamoDB tables continuous protection from accidental writes and deletes. With PITR, you do not have to worry about creating, maintaining, or scheduling backups. You enable PITR on your table and your backup is available for restore at any point in time from the moment you enable it, up to a maximum of the 35 preceding days. For example, imagine a test script writing accidentally to a production DynamoDB table. You could recover your table to any point in time within the last 35 days.\nOn-demand backups help with long-term archival requirements for regulatory compliance. On-demand backups give you full-control of managing the lifecycle of your backups, from creating as many backups as you need to retaining these for as long as you need.\nEnabling PITR during deployment\nYou can enable point-in-time recovery on all existing tables in your config.yml. Add the following configuration to your config.yml under a deployment section:\ndefault:\n\n    enablePointInTime: true\n\nImoprtant Note: Configuring point-in-time recovery is not supported by the CloudFormation (as of June 2018). We enable this feature deployment using AWS API. However, due to a limitation of AWS API, the feature fails to be enabled if it is running against newly created tables.\nTherefore, if you are deploying a new stack, make sure the feature is turned off on your first deployment. You can turn it on and enable about an hour after your tables are created.\nBackup and Restore with cumulus-api CLI\ncumulus-api CLI also includes a backup and restore command. The CLI backup command downloads the content of any of your DynamoDB tables to .json files. You can also use these .json files to restore the records to another DynamoDB table.\nBackup with the CLI\nTo backup a table with the CLI, make sure @cumulus/api package is installed. Then run:\n $ ./node_modules/.bin/cumulus-api backup --table \nthe backup will be stored at backups/.json\nRestore with the CLI\nTo restore data from a json file run the following command:\n $ ./node_modules/.bin/cumulus-api restore backups/.json --table \nDynamoDB Auto Scaling\n@cumulus/deployment enables auto scaling of DyanmoDB tables. Auto scaling is configurable by table. @cumulus/deployment will setup auto scaling with some default values by simply adding the following lines to an app/config.yml file:\n:\n  PdrsTable:\n    enableAutoScaling: true\nDefaults\nBy default, @cumulus/deployment will configure auto scaling with the following provisioned throughput values:\n\n\n\n\nRead\nWrite\n\n\n\n\nMin Capacity\n5\n1\n\n\nMax Capacity\n10\n2\n\n\n\nTables are launched with Min Capacity provisioned. To determine when to scale up or down, DynamoDB uses a Cloudwatch alarm to trigger autoscaling whenever read / write throughput exceeds some percentage of the current provisioned througput value. The following values are used to determine how and when to scale:\n\nTargetValue: A numeric value between 0 and 100 representing a percentage. When request througput exceeds or falls below TargetValue percent of the current provisioned value, DynamoDB scales up or down to TargetValue of current throughput.\nTargetValue defaults to 30, but can also be overriden in app/config.yml.\nScaleInCooldown and ScaleOutCooldown: A numeric value representing the number of seconds DynamoDB Auto Scaling throughput should exhibit exceeding or subceeding the TargetValue percent of provisioned throughput before scaling up or down.\nScaleInCooldown and ScaleOutCooldown default to 0 but can be overriden in app/config.yml\n\nRead more on the AWS Blog: How to use AWS CloudFormation to configure auto scaling for Amazon DynamoDB\nExample\nA fully customized app/config.yml for DynamoDB auto scaling might look something like the following:\n:\n  AutoScalingPolicyConfiguration:\n    targetValue: 70\n    scaleInCooldown: 5\n    scaleOutCooldown: 5\n  CollectionsTable:\n    enableAutoScaling: true\n    ReadMinCapacity: 5\n    ReadMaxCapacity: 10\n    WriteMinCapacity: 1\n    WriteMaxCapacity: 2\n  ProvidersTable:\n    ...\n  RulesTable:\n    ...\n  UsersTable:\n    ...\n  GranulesTable:\n    ...\n  PdrsTable:\n    ...\n  ExecutionsTable:\n    ...  \n  FilesTable:\n    enableAutoScaling: true\n    ReadMinCapacity: 5\n    ReadMaxCapacity: 10\n    WriteMinCapacity: 20\n    WriteMaxCapacity: 100\nImportant Note!\nDynamoDB Auto Scaling does not happen instantaneously. Delays of up to 10 minutes in auto scaling were experienced when load testing, and some requests failed. If application owners expect a high volume of throughput (for example, when doing a re-processing campaign), they should deploy tables with min capacity set at the required levels for meeting the expected request load.\n"},"ems_reporting.html":{"url":"ems_reporting.html","title":"EMS Reporting","keywords":"","body":"EMS reporting\nCumulus reports usage statistics to the ESDIS Metrics System (EMS).\nTwo types of reports are generated: ingest and distribution.\nIngest\nCumulus creates three ingest related reports for EMS: Ingest, Archive and Archive Delete.\nThe Ingest report contains records of all granules, products, or files that have been ingested into Cumulus.\nThe Archive report contains records of all granules, products, or files that have been archived into Cumulus.

Make sure to redeploy your IAM roles.\nConfig Changes\nConfigure system_bucket in iam/config.yml and app/config.yml - kes will use this instead of buckets.internal and the system_bucket in the workflows will be populated with this value. (Example)\nThe structure of buckets has changed. It is no longer key/value, but has a key, bucket name, and level. The key can be used in collection configurations so if the bucket name changes, it can be updated in the configuration without having to update collection definitions. (Example)\nThe new bucket structure should be put in iam/config.yml and app/config.yml. (IAM config.yml example and app config.yml example)\nFollowing deployment of 1.6.0, your distribution API Gateway URL will be changed and you will have to update your redirect URI on URS. Please note the output URLs in your deployment.\nWorkflow Configuration Changes\nTo support using metadata to configure storage locations, the Sync Granule task now writes to a staging location and the granule files are moved when the metadata becomes available. The MoveGranules task moves files to the correct location before Post to CMR.\nAdd MoveGranules to your workflow before Post to CMR. Lambdas.yml and Workflows.yml should be updated for this change. (Example)\nPost to CMR task:\n\nConfig:\nProcess required\nInput_granules no longer needed\n\n\nInput:\nGranules required. The granules object has been updated in the schema to include the expected format\n\n\nOutput (no updates required)\nProcess is now output\n\n\n\nSync Granules task:\n\nConfig:\nStack parameter added - used for the file staging directory when none is specified\nfileStagingDir parameter added - this can be used to specify a custom staging directory\nEither stack of fileStagingDir should be part of the config\n\n\nOutput (no updates required)\nfileStagingDir output\nUrl_path outputCumulus-process-py\n\n\n\n\nCumulus-process-py has been updated to accommodate granule files first being stored in a staging directory. You will need the latest version of cumulus-process-py.\n"},"upgrade/1.7.0.html":{"url":"upgrade/1.7.0.html","title":"1.7.0","keywords":"","body":"Upgrading to Cumulus 1.7.0\nCumulus 1.7 stores granules, pdrs and executions data in DynamoDB and uses ElasticSearch to only index and search them.\nIf you are upgrading to 1.7, it means you have granules, pdrs and executions data that are stored in your ElasticSearch instance but they have to be migrated to DynamoDB.\nCumulus 1.7 creates a lambda function for the migration.
